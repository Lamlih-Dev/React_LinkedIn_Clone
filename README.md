# LinkedIn Clone Using React & Redux (Frontend) And Firebase (Backend)
After learning React JS and beeing comfortable with it, i decided to clone LinkedIn. This is not like any other LinkedIn clone, most of them just clone the feed section
and that's it, just a single static page, but here it's a fully responsive (tablet, mobile, laptop) dynamic clone with email & google authentification, everything connected to the database using firebase.
